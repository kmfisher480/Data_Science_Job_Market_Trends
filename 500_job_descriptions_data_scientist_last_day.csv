Come and see why Fortune magazine consistently ranks The Trade Desk among the best small-medium-sized workplaces globally.About The RoleOur team is responsible for developing algorithms that run in our real time bidding platform with the ultimate goal of helping thousands of customers run effective advertising campaigns. Many of our problems involve getting deep learning algorithms to train and inference at scale. Some of the challenges include sparse and/or noisy labels and data, large output space (thousands of labels), millisecond latency requirements, high QPS requirements (thousands or millions per second), and unreliable ground truth.Data scientists on our team work closely with engineering throughout the lifecycle of the product, from ideation to productionalization and monitoring.Our data scientists are end-to-end owners. You will participate actively in all aspects of designing, researching, building, and delivering data-focused products for our clients.We are a team built on a foundation of generosity and openness, and we expect our data scientists to help make others better and raise the bar for those around them.

At our scale, many off-the-shelf modeling techniques (open source and enterprise) simply don't work. You are able to work from first principles to develop solutions and adapt them to a unique environment.You are a broadly skilled data scientist with deep expertise working with embedded models in always-onproduction systems and working across a variety of technologies and data sources.You have a product-focused mindset.

To complement this team, you will welcome ideas that are different from your own and be skilled at finding and building from common ground.You are a creative thinker, not bound by ""the way things have always been done."" What you know is less important than how well you learn and innovate. We don't need data scientists who know all the answers; we need data scientists who can invent the answers no one has thought of yet, to the questions yet to be asked.You have an abundance of intellectual curiosity and are enthusiastic to learn (and teach) new technologies / techniques.You are you comfortable working on an agile, distributed team spanning multiple time zones and continents.You are able to communicate effectively across both technical and non-technical audiences.What You Bring To The TableWe do not expect you to know every technology we use when you start at TTD. What we care most about is that you can learn quickly and solve complex problems using the best tools for the job.

ML is a top priority for Stripe in the coming years. With the phenomenal developments happening in the field of AI, we are positioned to accelerate the adoption of AI/ML across all parts of the company by building highly scalable and reliable foundational infrastructure.What you’ll doYou will work closely with machine learning engineers, data scientists, and platform infrastructure teams to build the powerful, flexible, and user-friendly systems that substantially increaseML-Opsvelocity across the company.ResponsibilitiesBuilding powerful, flexible, and user-friendly infrastructure that powers all of ML at Stripe.Designing and building fast, reliable services for ML model training and serving, and scaling that infrastructure across multiple regions.Creating services and libraries that enable ML engineers at Stripe to seamlessly transition from experimentation to production across Stripe’s systems.Pairing with product teams and ML engineers to develop easy-to-use infrastructure for production ML models.Who you areWe’re looking for people with a strong background or interest in building successful products or systems; you’re passionate about solving business problems and making impact, you are comfortable in dealing with lots of moving pieces; and you’re comfortable learning new technologies and systems. Many of our engineers work remotely from both the US and Canada, and we’d be happy to talk to you about the possibility of working remotely.It’s not expected that any single candidate would have expertise across all of these areas. For instance, we have wonderful team members who are really focused on their customers’ needs and building amazing user experiences, but didn’t come in with as much systems knowledge.Minimum Requirements3-5 years of experience building software applications in large scale distributed systems.A strong sense of curiosity and a desire to both learn and share knowledge with your peers. We like to work in a collaborative environment and hope you do too.A solid engineering background and experience with infrastructure and/or distributed systems.

While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.Pay and benefitsThe annual US base salary range for this role is $136,800 - $205,200. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.",8,Full-time,Mid-Senior level,Remote

Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.About The TeamRevenue Recognition is a crucial component of how companies evaluate their fiscal health and make decisions. Stripe Revenue Recognition tools enable accountants to automate understanding the impact of complex financial scenarios and avoid manual work, reduce errors, and get to accurate reports faster than ever before.Stripe Revenue Recognition is part of Stripe’s Revenue and Finance Automation (RFA) suite that gives businesses power over the entire life cycle of their cash flow. By coordinating billing, tax, reporting, and data services in one modern stack, Stripe’s revenue and finance automation suite eliminates the inefficiencies of legacy finance tools and supports revenue growth.While the internet has been a boon to productivity, the gains have been uneven. Common financial processes like billing, tax, and quarterly reporting are still painfully inefficient and manual. They’re also typically spread across a dozen or more software tools. The result: one-third of finance leaders reopen their books at least once a quarter because of accounting errors, and half spend 10 hours a month manually correcting discrepancies.Stripe’s RFA suite relieves those burdens by equipping finance leaders with revenue management tools that are as sophisticated as the businesses they run. The suite automates manual work and improves accuracy across the cash flow life cycle, from payments and billing to tax, reporting, and reconciliation.Our portfolio is growing rapidly and we are expanding our RFA suite to serve the diverse spectrum of Stripe’s users, from brand new startups to public companies. Simultaneously we are investing in foundations for an extensible platform solution, including integrations with external systems that will let us scale our reach and capabilities by orders of magnitude over the next few years.What you’ll doWe are seeking an experienced full stack engineer to join our team to build products that will streamline and automate common accounting tasks for Stripe customers from new venture-backed startups up to some of the biggest household names.ResponsibilitiesScope, architect, and lead technical projects to improve on existing features and solve new problems.Design, build, and maintain user-facing experiences, services, APIs, and systems.Make effective tradeoffs that consider business priorities, user experience, and a sustainable technical foundation.Debug production issues across services and multiple levels of the stackDevelop and execute against both short- and long-term roadmaps.Teach and mentor engineers to grow into the next generation of leaders at Stripe.Partner with engineers and product managers on infrastructure and other product teams to ensure your features are part of an integrated Stripe suite.Establish and uphold best practices in engineering, security, and technical designWho you areWe’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.Minimum Requirements3+ years of experience building back-end distributed systems, data processing systems, or front-end applications.You have excellent written and verbal communication skills.You enjoy learning about the businesses that use Stripe and building products to help them solve their problems.You work collaboratively cross-functionally and with stakeholders across teams and organization boundaries.You have experience mentoring junior engineers.You value and enjoy working with a diverse group of people with different expertise.Preferred QualificationsFamiliarity with large scale distributed systems or big data processing systems.Experience working in high-growth teams similar to Stripe.Experience building financial systems or tools for financial experts.Hybrid work at StripeThis role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.Pay and benefitsThe annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$172,000 - C$258,000. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.",7,Full-time,Mid-Senior level,N/A

Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.About The TeamRevenue Recognition is a crucial component of how companies evaluate their fiscal health and make decisions. Stripe Revenue Recognition tools enable accountants to automate understanding the impact of complex financial scenarios and avoid manual work, reduce errors, and get to accurate reports faster than ever before.Stripe Revenue Recognition is part of Stripe’s Revenue and Finance Automation (RFA) suite that gives businesses power over the entire life cycle of their cash flow. By coordinating billing, tax, reporting, and data services in one modern stack, Stripe’s revenue and finance automation suite eliminates the inefficiencies of legacy finance tools and supports revenue growth.While the internet has been a boon to productivity, the gains have been uneven. Common financial processes like billing, tax, and quarterly reporting are still painfully inefficient and manual. They’re also typically spread across a dozen or more software tools. The result: one-third of finance leaders reopen their books at least once a quarter because of accounting errors, and half spend 10 hours a month manually correcting discrepancies.Stripe’s RFA suite relieves those burdens by equipping finance leaders with revenue management tools that are as sophisticated as the businesses they run. The suite automates manual work and improves accuracy across the cash flow life cycle, from payments and billing to tax, reporting, and reconciliation.Our portfolio is growing rapidly and we are expanding our RFA suite to serve the diverse spectrum of Stripe’s users, from brand new startups to public companies. Simultaneously we are investing in foundations for an extensible platform solution, including integrations with external systems that will let us scale our reach and capabilities by orders of magnitude over the next few years.What you’ll doWe are seeking an experienced full stack engineer to join our team to build products that will streamline and automate common accounting tasks for Stripe customers from new venture-backed startups up to some of the biggest household names.ResponsibilitiesScope, architect, and lead technical projects to improve on existing features and solve new problems.Design, build, and maintain user-facing experiences, services, APIs, and systems.Make effective tradeoffs that consider business priorities, user experience, and a sustainable technical foundation.Debug production issues across services and multiple levels of the stackDevelop and execute against both short- and long-term roadmaps.Teach and mentor engineers to grow into the next generation of leaders at Stripe.Partner with engineers and product managers on infrastructure and other product teams to ensure your features are part of an integrated Stripe suite.Establish and uphold best practices in engineering, security, and technical designWho you areWe’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.Minimum Requirements3+ years of experience building back-end distributed systems, data processing systems, or front-end applications.You have excellent written and verbal communication skills.You enjoy learning about the businesses that use Stripe and building products to help them solve their problems.You work collaboratively cross-functionally and with stakeholders across teams and organization boundaries.You have experience mentoring junior engineers.You value and enjoy working with a diverse group of people with different expertise.Preferred QualificationsFamiliarity with large scale distributed systems or big data processing systems.Experience working in high-growth teams similar to Stripe.Experience building financial systems or tools for financial experts.Hybrid work at StripeThis role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.Pay and benefitsThe annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$172,000 - C$258,000. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process.
